__Razorback Suckers__ were collected in 2014 on the San Juan River.
Elemental [isotopic ratios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotope_analysis)
from finrays were analyzed for Ba (Barium 56), Ca (Calcium 20), Mg (Magnesium 12), and Sr (Strontium 38).
Finrays are non-lethally obtained and are used to detect natal origin since the
material in the reys are partially developed early in life.

__The issue__ is that hatchery fish can get into the river and lose their tags.
It is important for environmental resource managers to know whether untagged fish are wild or hatchery fish.
There are five fish sources in the dataset.

```
5 Sources

Hatchery
  DEX = Dexter National Fish Hatchery
  GJH = Ouray  National Fish Hatchery, Grand Valley Unit

Wild
  NAP = NAPI ponds
  SJR = San Juan River

Unknown
  UNK = untagged Razorback Suckers captured in the San Juan River
        these could be from any of the above sources
```

__Our goal__ is to test whether the known source populations
  have different multivariate means, and if so, which pairs of populations differ.

## __(1 p)__ Clean and transform data

Looking at the scatterplot matrix below, clean and/or transform the data if you think it will be helpful.
Note that measurement error can be an issue in complicated biological measurements.
Furthermore, a transformation might help separate observations that are tightly grouped in space.

__Please download__ the data into your working directory to save downloads from
my website each time you knit this document.

```{R}
library(erikmisc)
library(tidyverse)

# First, download the data to your computer,
#   save in the same folder as this Rmd file.

# read the data
dat_sjrs_full <-
  read_csv(
    "ADA2_CL_23_Clustering_SanJuanRazorbackSuckers_data2014.csv"
  )

dim(dat_sjrs_full)
# the last set of observations only have a few isotopes, so exclude
dat_sjrs <-
  dat_sjrs_full %>%
  na.omit()

dim(dat_sjrs)
# no missing values
dat_sjrs %>%
  is.na() %>%
  sum()
#str(dat_sjrs)

dat_sjrs <-
  dat_sjrs %>%
  select(
    Source
  , Ba137:Sr88
  ) %>%
  filter(
    # Exclude unknown sources
    Source != "UNK"
  )
names(dat_sjrs)



### SOLUTION
# if necessary, some data modifications here informed from your analysis

## __(1 p)__ Known fish scatterplot

Note that this plot can take a while to generate.
You're welcome to subset the data further for this plot if some of the variables are redundant.
You could probably get away with 5 columns of data without any loss of interpretation.
If you want to do this, replace the `dat_sjrs` in the `ggpairs()` function with
  `subset(dat_sjrs, select = c(col1, col2, ...))` and specify the columns to plot.
However, do the analysis using all the columns of data.

```{R, fig.height = 8, fig.width = 8, cache = TRUE}
# Scatterplot matrix
library(ggplot2)
library(GGally)
p <- ggpairs(dat_sjrs
            , mapping = ggplot2::aes(colour = Source, alpha = 0.5)
            , upper = list(continuous = "density", combo = "box")
            , lower = list(continuous = "points", combo = "dot")
            #, lower = list(continuous = "cor")
            , title = "Original data by source"
            )
print(p)
```

__Describe__ the relationships between isotopes of the same element (same atomic number) and between different elements.

__Source populations__ may or may not be different, describe the source differences you see.

## __(2 p)__ MANOVA Assumptions

Below are Shapiro-Wilk test for multivariate normality,
  as well as QQ-plots comparing the Mahalanobis D2 distance to a chi-squared distribution.
Keep in mind that we have large sample sizes,
  so the numeric tests may be too sensitive.
We do expect some deviations for the extreme D2 values, but they should not be too systematic.
If there are gross violations of normality,
  try a transformation(s) in a subset of the original variables that improve this.

```{R, fig.height = 8, fig.width = 8}
# Test multivariate normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test for multivariate normality
library(mvnormtest)
# The data needs to be transposed t() so each variable is a row
#   with observations as columns.
mshapiro.test(dat_sjrs %>% filter(Source == "DEX") %>% select(Ba137:Sr88) %>% t())
mshapiro.test(dat_sjrs %>% filter(Source == "GJH") %>% select(Ba137:Sr88) %>% t())
mshapiro.test(dat_sjrs %>% filter(Source == "NAP") %>% select(Ba137:Sr88) %>% t())
mshapiro.test(dat_sjrs %>% filter(Source == "SJR") %>% select(Ba137:Sr88) %>% t())

par(mfrow=c(2,2))
e_plot_mnv_norm_qqplot(dat_sjrs %>% filter(Source == "DEX") %>% select(Ba137:Sr88), name = "DEX")
e_plot_mnv_norm_qqplot(dat_sjrs %>% filter(Source == "GJH") %>% select(Ba137:Sr88), name = "GJH")
e_plot_mnv_norm_qqplot(dat_sjrs %>% filter(Source == "NAP") %>% select(Ba137:Sr88), name = "NAP")
e_plot_mnv_norm_qqplot(dat_sjrs %>% filter(Source == "SJR") %>% select(Ba137:Sr88), name = "SJR")
```

__Summarize__ the normality results after trying to address any deviations.

## __(3 p)__ MANOVA

Below is the result of the MANOVA test.

__State__ the null and alternative hypotheses in words and notation.

__Select__ the robust test statistic and
  __interpret__ the result in the context of the dataset.

```{R}
# Multivariate MANOVA test
library(car)
lm_man <- lm(cbind(Ba137, Ba138, Ca43, Mg24, Mg25, Mg26, Sr86, Sr87, Sr88) ~ Source, data = dat_sjrs)
man_dat_sjrs <- Manova(lm_man)
man_dat_sjrs
```

## __(2 p)__ Multiple comparisons

Below I wrote nested loops to compare all pairs of Sources.

The output gives a title for which comparisons are being made with the test result.

```{R}
# Multivariate MANOVA test

# NOTE: I specify pairs of sources by identifying the sorted unique list of Sources
Source_list <- dat_sjrs %>% pull(Source) %>% unique() %>% sort()
Source_list
# then I pull out pairs by index, like this
Source_list[c(1,2)]
# I think this is much easier than typing all names for the pairs of Sources

# for each pair of Sources
for (i_1 in 1:(length(Source_list) - 1)) {
  for (i_2 in (i_1 + 1):length(Source_list)) {
    # print a header to indicate which comparisons are being made
    cat("\n\n")
    cat(paste("***** Comparison between", i_1, Source_list[i_1], "and", i_2, Source_list[i_2]))

    # perform pairwise comparison
    library(car)
    man_pair <- Manova(lm(cbind(Ba137, Ba138, Ca43, Mg24, Mg25, Mg26, Sr86, Sr87, Sr88) ~ Source
               , data = dat_sjrs %>% filter(Source %in% Source_list[c(i_1, i_2)])
           ))
    # print result
    print(man_pair)
  }
}
```

__Specify__ the Bonferroni-corrected $\alpha$ level for pairwise tests.

__Indicate__ which pairs differ at this $\alpha$ level.

## __(1 p)__ Canonical Discriminant functions (visualize differences)

The canonical discriminant analysis will indicate the directions that provide the
  greatest ability to distinguish between the groups.

```{R, fig.height = 6, fig.width = 6}
# perform canonical discriminant analysis
library(candisc)
can_dat_sjrs <- candisc(lm_man)

## Scatterplot matrix
library(ggplot2)
#suppressMessages(suppressWarnings(library(GGally)))
library(GGally)
p <- ggpairs(can_dat_sjrs$scores
            , mapping = ggplot2::aes(colour = Source, alpha = 0.5)
            , upper = list(continuous = "density", combo = "box")
            , lower = list(continuous = "points", combo = "dot")
            #, lower = list(continuous = "cor")
            , title = "Canonical discriminant variables by source"
            )
print(p)
```

__How__ do the MANOVA differences found above reveal themselves in the projections provided
  by the discriminant variables?

__Which__ discriminant variables are useful for detecting which differences?
