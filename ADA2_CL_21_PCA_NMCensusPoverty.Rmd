# NM County-level Poverty Data

In this example we'll use NM county-level poverty data to understand how
  counties differ by living conditions, and how those living conditions
  vary together.
We hope to reduce our 13-dimensional dataset to the vital few components
  that explain about 75% of the variability.

__Maps:__ _Labels are easier to read on the left, but road features on right make the counties easier to place._

### Solution

[answer]



## __(1 p)__ Remove the one most extreme county

One coutry is seriously "rustic".
Remove that one observation at the end of the data section above,
  then rerun the analysis.

### Solution

## __(0 p)__ PCA using correlation matrix

The PCA output below will be used for the rest of the assignment.

```{R, fig.height = 5, fig.width = 8}
pca_nmcensus <-
  princomp(
    dat_nmcensus[, use_col_ind]
  , cor = TRUE
  )
summary(pca_nmcensus)

pca_nmcensus %>% loadings() %>% print(cutoff = 0.2) # cutoff = 0 to show all values

par(mfrow=c(1,2))
screeplot(pca_nmcensus)
biplot(pca_nmcensus)
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
```

## __(1 p)__ Dimension reduction

__How many__ principal components would you retain to explain about 3/4ths of the total variability?
How much variability is actually retained?

To answer this question, I would like you to embed R notation in the sentence
  you write to print the variability proportion.
For example:

* Retaining 2 components explains
  `r signif(sum(summary(pca_nmcensus)$sdev[1:2]^2) / sum(summary(pca_nmcensus)$sdev^2), 4)`
  of the total variability.

This is calculated by squaring the standard deviations of each component to get the variances,
  adding the first two variances (the indices `[1:2]`),
  then dividing by the sum of all the variances.
That ratio give the proportion of variance for the first two components.

### Solution

[answer]




## __(3 p)__ PC interpretations

__Interpret the number of principal components you retained__ in the previous step.

_Here's an interpretation of the first component._

PC`r i_print <- 1; signif(i_print,1)` explains
`r signif(100*pca_nmcensus$sdev[i_print]^2/sum(pca_nmcensus$sdev^2), 3)`%
of the total variation.

As PC`r signif(i_print,1)` increases,
  households heating with gas and electric _increase_,
  __while__
  poverty, rent greater than 35% of income, propotion with no phone or plumbing,
  heating with wood, owner-occupied dwellings, and vacant homes _decrease_.

I'm surprised to learn that heating with wood and poverty are related,
  everything else makes sense.
This seems to be the primary poverty component.

_Interpret the rest below._

### Solution

[answer]

PC`r i_print <- 2; signif(i_print,1)` explains
`r signif(100*pca_nmcensus$sdev[i_print]^2/sum(pca_nmcensus$sdev^2), 3)`%
of the total variation.

As PC`r signif(i_print,1)` increases,



PC`r i_print <- 3; signif(i_print,1)` explains
`r signif(100*pca_nmcensus$sdev[i_print]^2/sum(pca_nmcensus$sdev^2), 3)`%
of the total variation.

As PC`r signif(i_print,1)` increases,



etc.





## __(3 p)__ Visualizing and interpretting PCs

Here are two-dimensional plots of PC1 against PC2, PC1 against PC3, and PC2 against PC3.
The points and labels are colored by poverty proportion.

```{R, fig.height = 6, fig.width = 5}
library(ggplot2)
p1 <- ggplot(as.data.frame(pca_nmcensus$scores), aes(x = Comp.1, y = Comp.2, colour = dat_nmcensus$PovAll))
p1 <- p1 + scale_colour_gradientn(colours=c("red", "blue"))
p1 <- p1 + geom_text(aes(label = dat_nmcensus$County), vjust = -0.5, alpha = 0.25)
p1 <- p1 + geom_point(size = 3)
p1 <- p1 + theme(legend.position="bottom")
p2 <- ggplot(as.data.frame(pca_nmcensus$scores), aes(x = Comp.1, y = Comp.3, colour = dat_nmcensus$PovAll))
p2 <- p2 + scale_colour_gradientn(colours=c("red", "blue"))
p2 <- p2 + geom_text(aes(label = dat_nmcensus$County), vjust = -0.5, alpha = 0.25)
p2 <- p2 + geom_point(size = 3)
p2 <- p2 + theme(legend.position="none")
p3 <- ggplot(as.data.frame(pca_nmcensus$scores), aes(x = Comp.2, y = Comp.3, colour = dat_nmcensus$PovAll))
p3 <- p3 + scale_colour_gradientn(colours=c("red", "blue"))
p3 <- p3 + geom_text(aes(label = dat_nmcensus$County), vjust = -0.5, alpha = 0.25)
p3 <- p3 + geom_point(size = 3)
p3 <- p3 + theme(legend.position="none")

print(p1)
```
```{R, fig.height = 6, fig.width = 10}
library(gridExtra)
grid.arrange(grobs = list(p2, p3), nrow=1, top = "Scatterplots of first three PCs")

#### For a rotatable 3D plot, use plot3d() from the rgl library
# ##   This uses the R version of the OpenGL (Open Graphics Library)
# library(rgl)
# plot3d(x = pca_nmcensus$scores[,"Comp.1"]
#      , y = pca_nmcensus$scores[,"Comp.2"]
#      , z = pca_nmcensus$scores[,"Comp.3"])
```

__Using your interpretations of PC1 and PC2 above__,
  describe these three counties:
  __Bernalillo, Mora, and Roosevelt__.

_As an example, here's a description for Los Alamos._

__Los Alamos__ has large PC1 and large PC2, this indicates
  (both) there is very low poverty,
  (PC1) dwellings heat with gas and electric, and
  (PC2) there tends to be high dwelling vacancy.

The characteristics roughly match that description:
```{R}
dat_nmcensus %>% filter(County == "Los Alamos") %>% print(n = Inf, width = Inf)
```

### Solution

[answer]

__Bernalillo__ has XXX PC1 and XXX PC2, this indicates
  (both)
  (PC1)
  (PC2)

The characteristics (do/do not) match that description:
```{R}
# check after you describe it using the PCs
#dat_nmcensus %>% filter(County == "Bernalillo") %>% print(n = Inf, width = Inf)
```

__Mora__ has XXX PC1 and XXX PC2, this indicates
  (both)
  (PC1)
  (PC2)

The characteristics (do/do not) match that description:
```{R}
# check after you describe it using the PCs
#dat_nmcensus %>% filter(County == "Mora") %>% print(n = Inf, width = Inf)
```

__Roosevelt__ has XXX PC1 and XXX PC2, this indicates
  (both)
  (PC1)
  (PC2)

The characteristics (do/do not) match that description:
```{R}
# check after you describe it using the PCs
#dat_nmcensus %>% filter(County == "Roosevelt") %>% print(n = Inf, width = Inf)
```
