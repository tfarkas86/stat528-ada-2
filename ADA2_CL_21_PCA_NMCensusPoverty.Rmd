# NM County-level Poverty Data

In this example we'll use NM county-level poverty data to understand how
  counties differ by living conditions, and how those living conditions
  vary together.
We hope to reduce our 13-dimensional dataset to the vital few components
  that explain about 75% of the variability.

__Maps:__ _Labels are easier to read on the left, but road features on right make the counties easier to place._

# First, download the data to your computer,
#   save in the same folder as this Rmd file.

Place your code to subset, filter, or transform variables in this code chunk below.

```{R}
dat_nmcensus <-
  dat_nmcensus %>%
  filter(
    !Area %in% c(31)
  ) %>%
  mutate(across(Rent35, ~ ifelse(County == "De Baca", mean(.x), .x)))

```

## __(2 p)__ Scatterplot matrix of variables of interest

```{R, fig.height = 8, fig.width = 8}
# Scatterplot matrix
library(ggplot2)
library(GGally)
p <-
  ggpairs(
    dat_nmcensus %>% select(use_col_names)
  )
print(p)
```

In the scatterplot matrix __describe qualitatively what you see__.

### Solution

Firstly, there is a rather substantial outlier, McKinley County, with extremely proportions of homes without phone or plumbing. This county appears to be driving relationships with poverty, so I'm going to remove it. Also, De Baca county shows 0 percent of homes with rent over 35% of income, a major outlier for that feature. I imputed with the mean.

We see in the scatterplots a variety of correlations, including a relationship between use of wood heat and vacant homes, heat type and owner occupancy, presence of a phone and plumbing and heat type, heat type and rental cost, and poverty and presence of a phone. Overall, only presence of a phone shows a significant correlation with poverty in bivariate analysis. 

## __(1 p)__ Remove the one most extreme county

One coutry is seriously "rustic".
Remove that one observation at the end of the data section above,
  then rerun the analysis.

### Solution

Already done!

## __(0 p)__ PCA using correlation matrix

The PCA output below will be used for the rest of the assignment.

```{R, fig.height = 5, fig.width = 8}
pca_nmcensus <-
  princomp(
    dat_nmcensus[, use_col_ind]
  , cor = TRUE
  )
summary(pca_nmcensus)

pca_nmcensus %>% loadings() %>% print(cutoff = 0.2) # cutoff = 0 to show all values

par(mfrow=c(1,2))
screeplot(pca_nmcensus)
biplot(pca_nmcensus)
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
```

## __(1 p)__ Dimension reduction

__How many__ principal components would you retain to explain about 3/4ths of the total variability?
How much variability is actually retained?

To answer this question, I would like you to embed R notation in the sentence
  you write to print the variability proportion.
For example:

* Retaining 2 components explains
  `r signif(sum(summary(pca_nmcensus)$sdev[1:2]^2) / sum(summary(pca_nmcensus)$sdev^2), 4)`
  of the total variability.

This is calculated by squaring the standard deviations of each component to get the variances,
  adding the first two variances (the indices `[1:2]`),
  then dividing by the sum of all the variances.
That ratio give the proportion of variance for the first two components.

### Solution

Retaining 4 components explains
  `r signif(sum(summary(pca_nmcensus)$sdev[1:4]^2) / sum(summary(pca_nmcensus)$sdev^2), 4)`
  of the total variability.




## __(3 p)__ PC interpretations

__Interpret the number of principal components you retained__ in the previous step.

_Here's an interpretation of the first component._

PC`r i_print <- 1; signif(i_print,1)` explains
`r signif(100*pca_nmcensus$sdev[i_print]^2/sum(pca_nmcensus$sdev^2), 3)`%
of the total variation.

As PC`r signif(i_print,1)` increases,
  households heating with gas and electric _increase_,
  __while__
  poverty, rent greater than 35% of income, propotion with no phone or plumbing,
  heating with wood, owner-occupied dwellings, and vacant homes _decrease_.

I'm surprised to learn that heating with wood and poverty are related,
  everything else makes sense.
This seems to be the primary poverty component.



_Interpret the rest below._

### Solution

PC`r i_print <- 1; signif(i_print,1)` explains
`r signif(100*pca_nmcensus$sdev[i_print]^2/sum(pca_nmcensus$sdev^2), 3)`%
of the total variation.

As PC`r signif(i_print,1)` increases,
  household vacancy, owner occupancy, heating with wood, lack of plumbing and phone, rent above  35%, and poverty all _increase_,
  __while__ heating with alternate fuels decreases.
  
PC 1 appears to capture a rural to urban, rich to poor spectrum. 

PC`r i_print <- 2; signif(i_print,1)` explains
`r signif(100*pca_nmcensus$sdev[i_print]^2/sum(pca_nmcensus$sdev^2), 3)`%
of the total variation.

As PC`r signif(i_print,1)` increases, household vacancy, rental vacancy, owner occupancy, and heating with gas all increase, whereas electric heating lack of phone, and poverty all decrease.  

PC`r i_print <- 3; signif(i_print,1)` explains
`r signif(100*pca_nmcensus$sdev[i_print]^2/sum(pca_nmcensus$sdev^2), 3)`%
of the total variation.

As PC`r signif(i_print,1)` increases, household and rental vacancy plus electric heating increase, whereas gas heating, lack of plumbing, and rent over 35% of income all decrease. 

PCs 2 and 3 seem to represent places with declining populations, perhaps? Given all the vacancies. But that doesn't seem necessarily to correlated with poverty. 

PC`r i_print <- 4; signif(i_print,1)` explains
`r signif(100*pca_nmcensus$sdev[i_print]^2/sum(pca_nmcensus$sdev^2), 3)`%
of the total variation.

As PC`r signif(i_print,1)` increases, rent of 35% of income increases, whereas rental vacancy, gas heat, lack of plumbing and phone, and poverty all decrease. 

This might represent areas with well-to-do rental communities. 

## __(3 p)__ Visualizing and interpretting PCs

Here are two-dimensional plots of PC1 against PC2, PC1 against PC3, and PC2 against PC3.
The points and labels are colored by poverty proportion.

```{R, fig.height = 6, fig.width = 5}
library(ggplot2)
p1 <- ggplot(as.data.frame(pca_nmcensus$scores), aes(x = Comp.1, y = Comp.2, colour = dat_nmcensus$PovAll))
p1 <- p1 + scale_colour_gradientn(colours=c("red", "blue"))
p1 <- p1 + geom_text(aes(label = dat_nmcensus$County), vjust = -0.5, alpha = 0.25)
p1 <- p1 + geom_point(size = 3)
p1 <- p1 + theme(legend.position="bottom")
p2 <- ggplot(as.data.frame(pca_nmcensus$scores), aes(x = Comp.1, y = Comp.3, colour = dat_nmcensus$PovAll))
p2 <- p2 + scale_colour_gradientn(colours=c("red", "blue"))
p2 <- p2 + geom_text(aes(label = dat_nmcensus$County), vjust = -0.5, alpha = 0.25)
p2 <- p2 + geom_point(size = 3)
p2 <- p2 + theme(legend.position="none")
p3 <- ggplot(as.data.frame(pca_nmcensus$scores), aes(x = Comp.2, y = Comp.3, colour = dat_nmcensus$PovAll))
p3 <- p3 + scale_colour_gradientn(colours=c("red", "blue"))
p3 <- p3 + geom_text(aes(label = dat_nmcensus$County), vjust = -0.5, alpha = 0.25)
p3 <- p3 + geom_point(size = 3)
p3 <- p3 + theme(legend.position="none")

print(p1)
```
```{R, fig.height = 6, fig.width = 10}
library(gridExtra)
grid.arrange(grobs = list(p2, p3), nrow=1, top = "Scatterplots of first three PCs")

#### For a rotatable 3D plot, use plot3d() from the rgl library
# ##   This uses the R version of the OpenGL (Open Graphics Library)
# library(rgl)
# plot3d(x = pca_nmcensus$scores[,"Comp.1"]
#      , y = pca_nmcensus$scores[,"Comp.2"]
#      , z = pca_nmcensus$scores[,"Comp.3"])
```

__Using your interpretations of PC1 and PC2 above__,
  describe these three counties:
  __Bernalillo, Mora, and Roosevelt__.

_As an example, here's a description for Los Alamos._

__Los Alamos__ has large PC1 and large PC2, this indicates
  (both) there is very low poverty,
  (PC1) dwellings heat with gas and electric, and
  (PC2) there tends to be high dwelling vacancy.

The characteristics roughly match that description:
```{R}
dat_nmcensus %>% filter(County == "Los Alamos") %>% print(n = Inf, width = Inf)
```

### Solution

[answer]

__Bernalillo__ has low PC1 and average PC2, this indicates
  (both) low ownership, low vacancy, higih phone usage, low poverty
  (PC1) heating with fuel other than wood, low rental costs, high income to rent ratio
  (PC2) split fuel between gas and electric.  

The characteristics (do/do not) match that description:
```{R}
# check after you describe it using the PCs
#dat_nmcensus %>% filter(County == "Bernalillo") %>% print(n = Inf, width = Inf)
```

__Mora__ has high PC1 and low PC2, this indicates
  (both) not a lot of gas heat, few houses with phones, high poverty
  (PC1) much wood heat, many houses without plumbing, many households with more than 35% of income going to rent, 
  (PC2) many vacant rentals, 

The characteristics (do/do not) match that description:
```{R}
# check after you describe it using the PCs
#dat_nmcensus %>% filter(County == "Mora") %>% print(n = Inf, width = Inf)
```

__Roosevelt__ has low PC1 and low PC2, this indicates
  (both) few vacant owned homes, low home ownership, a lot of electric heat, 
  (PC1) little wood heat, much plumbing, few households with greater than 35% of income to rent
  (PC2) few vacant rentals, 

The characteristics (do/do not) match that description:
```{R}
# check after you describe it using the PCs
#dat_nmcensus %>% filter(County == "Roosevelt") %>% print(n = Inf, width = Inf)
```
