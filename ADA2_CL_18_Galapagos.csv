# M.P. Johnson and P.H. Raven, "Species number and endemism: The Galapagos
# Archipelago revisited", Science, 179, 893-895 (1973), have presented data
# giving the number of plant species and related variables for 29 different
# islands. Counts are given for both the total number of species and the number
# of species that occur only in the Galapagos (the endemics).
#
# Elevations for Baltra and Seymour obtained from web searches. Elevations for
# four other small islands obtained from large-scale maps.
#
# Variable    Description
# Island      Name of Island
# Plants      Number of plant species
# PlantEnd    Number of endemic plant species
# Finches     Number of finch species
# FinchEnd    Number of endemic finch species
# FinchGenera Number of finch genera
# Area        Area (km^2)
# Elevation   Maximum elevation (m)
# Nearest     Distance from to nearest island (km)
# StCruz      Distance to Santa Cruz Island (km)
# Adjacent    Area of adjacent island (km^2)
